# Physics of Data. Part XX

## Physics-Informed Learning Machines Literature

Please, find attached a new edition of the "Physics-Informed Learning Machines Literature" PDF with few hundred citations related to PIML, SciML, PINNs, Neural Operators, and other physics-enhanced methods.

Please, if you notice I am missing a seminal paper, or another important one, that you think it must be included, provide me the DOI, and I will include it in the next edition. You will get your name cited as a collaborator (*pending for next edition*).

Be warned, though, that no "AI" was hurt or abused during the edition of this report. Unfortunately, AI-LLMs have a severe limitation when performing a research of more than 10 to 20 papers; if they don't find literature during their search they start fabricating it.

## Features
* Every paper has its respective DOI as a link. You should be able to open the DOI source when you press click over the blueish link in the PDF. 
* Number of references cited per document
* Keyword PDF match indicator per document. `KDensity` is number of keywords matched divided by number of pages
* If the document has been nade reproducible by the authors, there will be a GitHub icon on that citation
