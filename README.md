# Physics of Data. Part XIX

## Physics-Informed Learning Machines Literature

Please, find attached a PDF with 455 citations related to Physics-Informed Learning Machines, SciML, PINNs. and other PIML methods.

This is, of course, a drop in the ocean of publications on the subject. But it is a start. I just made a query on my Obsidian vault, and voila. Got it formatted in PDF using Quarto!

Please, if you notice I am missing a seminal paper, or another important one, that you think it must be included, provide me the DOI, and I will include it in the next edition. You will get your name cited as a collaborator.

PS. Every paper has its respective DOI as a link. You should be able to open the DOI source when you press click over the blueish link in the PDF.
